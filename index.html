            <h3>HTML Background</h3>
            <p>You can write blocks of text in paragraph tags.
                Links look like this:
                <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css/intro-to-html/pt/html-basics">MORE HTML INFO</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                This seems super basic but every website you use is HTML - sometimes it's
                generated with the help another piece of software, but in the end it's there.
                For example, in your Google Sites projects (or any website), you can right click,
                and select inspect on any element of the page, and your browser's developer tools
                will show you the site's HTML.

            <h3> Price Table Assignment</h3>
            <p>Look up HTML tags to create a price table - ask Mrs. May for more information about
                what should be in your table. It should look like this:</p>
            <img src="table.png" alt="A screenshot of a pricing table example"/>
            <p>
                It should have the following tags:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A heading line</li>
                <li>An ordered and/or an unordered list</li>
                <li>A table with headings</li>
                <li>A paragraph</li>
                <li>Some form of text <stong>emphasis</stong></li>

            <h3> Make changes and submit a Pull Request </h3>
            <p>
                You can edit files using the Github GUI, make changes, and then submit
                a <strong>Pull Request</strong> to <strong>Merge</strong> your changes
                into the main branch. Others can review your changes and make suggestions
                for improvements or ask questions before you merge - while in the meantime
                - they can have their own separate branches with changes they are working on.
                This allows a bunch of people to work on the same project together without
                issues. By the way <a href="">git</a> doing the actual "work" of allowing you
                to make branches, track and merge changes, Github is really just a place to put your
                project (your "git repository").
            </p>
            <p>
                Edit this <em>index.html</em> file:
            </p>
            <img src="gh2.png" alt="The edit button in the Github GUI"/>
            <p>
                Once you are happy with your changes to the file, click the "Commit changes"
                button in the top right of this page. You will see a dialog like:</p>
            <img src="gh3.png" alt="The github commmit confirmation dialog"/>
            <p>
                Fill in the information describing your changes and create a new branch
                and pull request. Your classmates can now look at exactly what you changed
                and suggest edits or ask questions. Once it looks good, click "Merge" and
                your new changes will be shipped to the <em>main</em> branch!
            </p>

                For example - you can request reviews and discuss the changes - here's
                the PR for this branch:
