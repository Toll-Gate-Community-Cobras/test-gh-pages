            <h3>HTML Background</h3>
            <p>You can write blocks of text in paragraph tags.
                Links look like this:
                <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css/intro-to-html/pt/html-basics"> MORE HTML INFO</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                This seems super basic but every website you use is HTML - sometimes it's
                generated with the help another piece of software, but in the end it's there.
                For example, in your Google Sites projects (or any website), you can right click,
                and select inspect on any element of the page, and your browser's developer tools
                will show you the site's HTML.

            <h3> Price Table Assignment</h3>
            <p>Look up HTML tags to create a price table - ask Mrs. May for more information about
                what should be in your table. It should look like this:</p>
            <img src="table.png" alt="A screenshot of a pricing table example"/>
            <p>
                It should have the following tags:
                <ul>
                    <li>A heading line</li>
                    <li>An ordered and/or an unordered list</li>
                    <li>A table with headings</li>
                    <li>A paragraph</li>
                    <li>Some form of text <stong>emphasis</stong></li>
                </ul>
